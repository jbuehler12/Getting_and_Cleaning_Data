https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Have the extracted data folder of **UCI HAR dataset** in the working directory to successfully run the analysis

The run_analysis.R script:

1)Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2)Extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3)Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4)Labels the data set with descriptive variable names  

Creates a text file of tidy data with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (tidy_data.txt)
